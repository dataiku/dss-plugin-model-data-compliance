# Model Data Compliance

⚠️ Starting with DSS version 14 this plugin is considered "deprecated".

For proper monitoring of deployed ML models, a considerate data scientist/ML engineer want to check new data looks like training data.

## Scope of the plugin
This plugin offers a set of different DSS components to monitor input data:
* Custom metric: compute compliance metrics given a reference dataset or a saved model.
* Custom check: validate new data given a reference dataset or a saved model.


## Installation and requirements
